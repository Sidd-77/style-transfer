# Neural Style Transfer

This project is a Neural Style Transfer application that allows users to apply the style of one image to another. It uses a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub to perform the style transfer.

## Tech Stack

- **Streamlit**: A fast, efficient, and easy-to-use framework for building web applications.
- **TensorFlow**: An end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
- **TensorFlow Hub**: A repository of pre-trained TensorFlow models.

## Running the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sidd-77/style-transfer.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd style-transfer
```

3. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application should be now running at ```http://localhost:8501```
